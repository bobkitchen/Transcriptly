# Voice Overlap Fix Test

## Changes Made:

1. **Fixed completion handler logic** in `ReadAloudService.swift:310-326`:
   - Only set error state if we're actively playing when speech fails
   - Treat speech failures during stopped/paused states as intentional cancellation
   - Added comprehensive debug logging

2. **Fixed error binding** in `ReadAloudService.swift:39-49`:
   - Only set error state from VoiceProvider errors if currently playing
   - Prevent override of intentional stop/pause states

3. **Enhanced debug output** to track state changes and identify root cause

## Expected Behavior:
- When advance button is pressed during speech, voice should stop cleanly
- State should change from .playing â†’ .stopped 
- When startReading() is called again, it should work with state .stopped (which allows play)
- No more race condition setting state to .error

## Debug Output to Watch For:
- "ðŸ”„ SeekToSentence: Set state to .stopped"
- "ðŸ”„ Speech completion: success=false, currentState=stopped"
- "ðŸ”„ Speech failed but state is stopped - treating as intentional cancellation"
- "ðŸ”„ StartReading: Called with state=stopped" (not error)

## Test Steps:
1. Load a document in Read Aloud
2. Start reading
3. Press advance button during speech
4. Voice should stop and restart at next sentence
