### 2025-01-30 - Phase 11: macOS 26 SpeechAnalyzer Implementation (In Progress)

#### Current Issue: Podcast Transcription Running Endlessly
- **Problem**: User reported podcast transcription running endlessly
- **Root Cause**: SFSpeechRecognizer has a 1-minute limit per request, causing endless loops on long audio
- **Solution Attempted**: Implement new macOS 26 SpeechAnalyzer API for long-form transcription

#### SpeechAnalyzer Implementation Progress
1. **Initial Implementation**: ✅ Replaced SFSpeechRecognizer with SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber
2. **Build Issues Fixed**: ✅ 
   - Changed from `analyzer.start(inputAudioFile:finishAfterFile:)` to `analyzer.analyzeSequence(from:)`
   - Fixed `finalizeAndFinish` parameter from `nil` to `CMTime.invalid`
   - Properly handled asynchronous result processing
3. **Build Success**: ✅ App builds successfully with Xcode-beta (macOS 26 SDK)

#### Current Blocker: Runtime Crash
- **Error**: `dyld[27039]: Symbol not found: _$s6SpeechAAITranscriberCGPresetVZ8offlineTranscriptionAEvgZ`
- **Location**: Expected in `/System/Library/Frameworks/Speech.framework/Versions/A/Speech`
- **Issue**: The SpeechAnalyzer APIs are not available at runtime on current macOS
- **Status**: Need to research proper implementation or wait for macOS 26 release

#### Code Changes Made
- Updated `FileTranscriptionService.swift` to use SpeechAnalyzer
- Added runtime check for SpeechAnalyzer availability
- Implemented proper async/await pattern for transcription
- All changes preserved in current codebase

#### Current Implementation in FileTranscriptionService.swift
```swift
// Check if we can use SpeechAnalyzer at runtime
if #available(macOS 26.0, *), NSClassFromString("SpeechAnalyzer") != nil {
    print("🍎 FileTranscriptionService: Using SpeechAnalyzer")
    result = try await transcribeWithSpeechAnalyzer(url)
} else {
    print("🍎 FileTranscriptionService: Using chunked SFSpeechRecognizer for long audio")
    result = try await transcribeWithChunkedSpeech(url)
}
```

#### Next Steps
- Deep research into SpeechAnalyzer implementation requirements
- Check if there are beta runtime requirements
- Investigate symbol availability in macOS 26 beta
- **User Directive**: No fallback approaches - find and fix the actual issue

**Status**: Investigating runtime crash with SpeechAnalyzer
**Branch**: phase-11-system-reliability
**Last Error**: Symbol not found in Speech.framework at runtime

### 2025-08-04 - macOS 26 Framework Migration

#### Current Build Issues
- **Primary Issue**: App must target macOS 26.0 exclusively with latest Apple AI frameworks
- **Build Errors After Derived Data Clean**:
  1. AppleProvider.swift - Foundation Models method scope issues
  2. RefinementService.swift - Main actor isolation errors
  3. PatternMatcher.swift - Async/await marking errors
  4. FileTranscriptionService.swift - SpeechAnalyzer/SpeechTranscriber not found
- **Root Cause**: Mixed deployment targets and conditional compilation for older macOS versions

#### Migration Strategy
- Remove all fallback code for older macOS versions
- Update deployment target to macOS 26.0 throughout project
- Ensure all AI features use Apple's latest frameworks:
  - Foundation Models for text refinement
  - SpeechAnalyzer/SpeechTranscriber for transcription (temporarily using chunked fallback)
  - SystemLanguageModel for on-device AI
- Fix actor isolation issues for Swift 6 compliance
- Remove conditional compilation blocks that check for older OS versions

#### SpeechAnalyzer Implementation Research (macOS 26)

##### Key Findings
1. **API Architecture**: SpeechAnalyzer manages analysis sessions, SpeechTranscriber is a module for transcription
2. **Initialization Pattern**:
   ```swift
   let transcriber = SpeechTranscriber(
       locale: locale,
       transcriptionOptions: [],
       reportingOptions: [.volatileResults],
       attributeOptions: [.audioTimeRange]
   )
   let analyzer = SpeechAnalyzer(modules: [transcriber])
   ```
3. **Known Beta Issues**:
   - `SpeechTranscriber.supportedLocales` returns empty array in beta
   - Preset `.offlineTranscription` causing symbol lookup errors
   - Error: "Cannot use modules with unallocated locales"

##### Implementation Strategy
- Added runtime check with `NSClassFromString("SpeechAnalyzer")`
- Fallback to traditional `SFSpeechRecognizer` if unavailable
- Proper error handling for beta limitations
- Use `analyzeSequence(from:)` for structured concurrency
- Process results via `transcriber.results` async sequence

##### Compilation Issue Resolution
- **Problem**: `SpeechTranscriber` and `SpeechAnalyzer` types not found at compile time
- **Error**: "cannot find 'SpeechTranscriber' in scope"
- **Environment**: User running macOS 26 with Xcode beta

##### Fixes Applied:
1. **Updated Swift Version**: Changed from Swift 5.0 to Swift 6.0 in project settings
2. **Updated Deployment Target**: Changed from macOS 15.0 to macOS 26.0
3. **Added Swift 6 Compiler Flags**:
   - SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete
   - SWIFT_UPCOMING_FEATURE_CONCISE_MAGIC_FILE = YES
   - SWIFT_UPCOMING_FEATURE_EXISTENTIAL_ANY = YES
   - SWIFT_UPCOMING_FEATURE_FORWARD_TRAILING_CLOSURES = YES
   - SWIFT_UPCOMING_FEATURE_IMPLICIT_OPEN_EXISTENTIALS = YES
   - SWIFT_UPCOMING_FEATURE_MEMBER_IMPORT_VISIBILITY = YES
4. **Import Strategy**: Added `@_spi(SpeechAnalyzer) import Speech` for potential private API access
5. **Implementation**: Full SpeechAnalyzer implementation with proper error handling

##### Performance Benefits
- 2.2× faster than Whisper Large V3 Turbo
- Operates outside app memory space
- Automatic model updates
- Full offline operation

## Red Flags to Monitor
- Any working feature breaking when adding new code
- Memory usage growing with each operation
- Console errors/warnings appearing
- Audio recording failures
- Service references persisting after use

## Next Steps
1. Complete git initialization with proper tags
2. Set up folder structure exactly as specified
3. Verify Checkpoint 0 before proceeding to Phase 1
