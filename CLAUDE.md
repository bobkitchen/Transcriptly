# Claude Code Development Log - Transcriptly v3

## Project Overview
- **App Name**: Transcriptly
- **Platform**: macOS 26.0+ (native)
- **Framework**: SwiftUI with AppKit integration
- **Architecture**: Service-isolated, Liquid Glass UI
- **Current Phase**: Pre-Development Setup

## Key Architecture Principles
1. **Service Isolation**: No service dependencies on each other
2. **Resource Management**: Every allocation has cleanup
3. **Defensive Programming**: Extensive logging and error handling
4. **Liquid Glass First**: Apple HIG compliant from day one

## Development Log

### Session Start: 2025-06-25

#### Initial Assessment
- Reviewed product brief v3 and task list v3
- Understood lessons learned from previous failed attempt
- Key insight: Previous build failed due to cascading issues when adding features
- Solution: Strict service isolation, methodical phase-by-phase approach

#### Current Status
- Xcode project already created
- Starting with Task 0.2 (Git setup) and Task 0.3 (Folder structure)
- Need to establish tracking system before proceeding

#### Active Tasks
- [x] Task 0.2: Initial Git Setup - COMPLETED
- [x] Task 0.3: Create Base Folder Structure - COMPLETED
- [x] Checkpoint 0: Verify project builds and runs - COMPLETED

#### Ready for Phase 1
Phase 0 (Pre-Development Setup) is complete. Ready to begin Phase 1: Basic Dock App with Liquid Glass UI.

## Change Log

### 2025-06-25 - Session Start
- Created CLAUDE.md tracking document
- Created README.md project overview
- Set up todo tracking system
- Ready to begin Phase 0 tasks

### 2025-06-25 - Phase 0 Complete
- **Task 0.2**: Completed git setup with proper commits and tags
- **Task 0.3**: Created organized folder structure (App/, Models/, Views/, Services/, Utilities/, Resources/)
- **Checkpoint 0**: âœ… Project builds successfully, git repository initialized
- **Status**: Ready for Phase 1 - Basic Dock App with Liquid Glass UI
- **Git Tag**: v0.0.2-structure

## Red Flags to Monitor
- Any working feature breaking when adding new code
- Memory usage growing with each operation
- Console errors/warnings appearing
- Audio recording failures
- Service references persisting after use

## Next Steps
1. Complete git initialization with proper tags
2. Set up folder structure exactly as specified
3. Verify Checkpoint 0 before proceeding to Phase 1
