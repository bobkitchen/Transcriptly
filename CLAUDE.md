- Architecture supports future enhancements without refactoring
- UI foundation ready for advanced features

**Status**: Phase 2 Complete - All objectives achieved
**Version**: 0.6.0-phase2-complete
**Git Tag**: Ready for tagging

## Red Flags to Monitor
- Any working feature breaking when adding new code
- Memory usage growing with each operation
- Console errors/warnings appearing
- Audio recording failures
- Service references persisting after use

## Next Steps
1. Complete git initialization with proper tags
2. Set up folder structure exactly as specified
3. Verify Checkpoint 0 before proceeding to Phase 1
