# Claude Code Development Log - Transcriptly v3

## Project Overview
- **App Name**: Transcriptly
- **Platform**: macOS 26.0+ (native)
- **Framework**: SwiftUI with AppKit integration
- **Architecture**: Service-isolated, Liquid Glass UI
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 - AI Refinement and UI Restructuring

## Key Architecture Principles
1. **Service Isolation**: No service dependencies on each other
2. **Resource Management**: Every allocation has cleanup
3. **Defensive Programming**: Extensive logging and error handling
4. **Liquid Glass First**: Apple HIG compliant from day one

## Development Log

### Session Start: 2025-06-25

#### Initial Assessment
- Reviewed product brief v3 and task list v3
- Understood lessons learned from previous failed attempt
- Key insight: Previous build failed due to cascading issues when adding features
- Solution: Strict service isolation, methodical phase-by-phase approach

#### Current Status
- Xcode project already created
- Starting with Task 0.2 (Git setup) and Task 0.3 (Folder structure)
- Need to establish tracking system before proceeding

#### Active Tasks
- [x] Task 0.2: Initial Git Setup - COMPLETED
- [x] Task 0.3: Create Base Folder Structure - COMPLETED
- [x] Checkpoint 0: Verify project builds and runs - COMPLETED

#### Ready for Phase 1
Phase 0 (Pre-Development Setup) is complete. Ready to begin Phase 1: Basic Dock App with Liquid Glass UI.

## Change Log

### 2025-06-25 - Session Start
- Created CLAUDE.md tracking document
- Created README.md project overview
- Set up todo tracking system
- Ready to begin Phase 0 tasks

### 2025-06-25 - Phase 0 Complete
- **Task 0.2**: Completed git setup with proper commits and tags
- **Task 0.3**: Created organized folder structure (App/, Models/, Views/, Services/, Utilities/, Resources/)
- **Checkpoint 0**: ✅ Project builds successfully, git repository initialized
- **Status**: Ready for Phase 1 - Basic Dock App with Liquid Glass UI
- **Git Tag**: v0.0.2-structure

### 2025-06-25 - Phase 1 Complete
- **Task 1.1**: ✅ Main Window Implementation with unified toolbar and Liquid Glass design
- **Task 1.2**: ✅ Basic UI Layout with proper component separation (RecordingView, RefinementModeView, OptionsView, StatusView)  
- **Task 1.3**: ✅ Menu Bar Integration with minimal menu support (Show/Quit)
- **Checkpoint 1**: ✅ Beautiful empty UI shell with dock and menu bar presence
- **Status**: Ready for Phase 2 - Core Recording Functionality
- **Git Tag**: v0.1.0-ui-shell

#### Key Achievements
- Complete Liquid Glass compliant UI following Apple HIG
- All controls visible in main window (no complex settings)
- Proper component architecture with service isolation design
- Native controls with system colors and proper spacing
- Menu bar integration working
- Project builds and runs successfully

### 2025-06-25 - Phase 2 Complete
- **Task 2.1**: ✅ Audio Permissions implemented with macOS-specific AVCaptureDevice APIs
- **Task 2.2**: ✅ Basic Audio Recording with proper macOS AVAudioRecorder integration
- **Task 2.3**: ✅ Recording UI Integration with full button and status integration
- **Task 2.4**: ✅ Keyboard Shortcut (⌘⇧V) for in-app recording toggle
- **Checkpoint 2**: ✅ Can record audio via button or shortcut with clean start/stop

### 2025-06-25 - Phase 3 Complete (Initial Implementation)
- **Task 3.1**: ✅ Speech Framework Setup with Apple Speech framework and proper permissions
- **Task 3.2**: ✅ Basic Transcription with post-recording automatic transcription
- **Task 3.3**: ✅ Clipboard Integration with automatic copy-to-clipboard functionality
- **Task 3.4**: ✅ Complete Flow Integration connecting record→transcribe→paste workflow
- **Status**: Phase 1 complete - Core transcription MVP working

### 2025-06-26 - Phase 2 Start (AI Refinement and UI Restructuring)

#### Phase 2 Objectives
- Implement AI refinement with 4 modes (Raw, Clean-up, Email, Messaging)
- Restructure UI with sidebar navigation (Home, Transcription, AI Providers, Learning, Settings)
- Fix keyboard shortcuts and add mode switching (⌘1-4)
- Create capsule mode for minimal recording interface
- Add user-editable prompts for each refinement mode
- Prepare UI for future learning features (non-functional placeholders)

#### Known Issues from Phase 1
- Basic UI needs restructuring for better organization
- Refinement modes are placeholders only
- No proper settings section
- Keyboard shortcuts need enhancement

#### Phase 2 Success Metrics
- All existing features still work
- Refinement adds <1 second to processing
- UI feels native and polished
- Ready for Phase 3 without technical debt

#### Active Tasks
- [x] Task 2.0.1: Create Phase 2 branch
- [ ] Task 2.0.2: Update Documentation
- [ ] Task 2.0.3: Create New File Structure

## Red Flags to Monitor
- Any working feature breaking when adding new code
- Memory usage growing with each operation
- Console errors/warnings appearing
- Audio recording failures
- Service references persisting after use

## Next Steps
1. Complete git initialization with proper tags
2. Set up folder structure exactly as specified
3. Verify Checkpoint 0 before proceeding to Phase 1
