# Transcriptly Phase 11 - System Reliability & Feature Expansion - Project Brief

## Project Overview

**Phase Goal**: Resolve critical system reliability issues while expanding Transcriptly's capabilities with comprehensive file transcription, enhanced learning system, and improved user experience across all touch points.

**Current State**: Transcriptly has solid core functionality but suffers from keyboard shortcut conflicts, broken Supabase sync, disabled learning system, unclear dropzone UX, and lacks file transcription capabilities.

**Target Outcome**: A robust, fully-featured application that works reliably, learns from user interactions, and handles both live and file-based transcription seamlessly.

## Core Problems Being Solved

### **1. Keyboard Shortcut Conflicts & Management**
- **Current Issue**: ⌘⇧V conflicts with system shortcuts, shortcut recorder broken
- **User Problem**: Users can't reliably access app or customize shortcuts
- **Solution**: New conflict-free shortcut (⌘M), enhanced conflict detection, working shortcut recorder

### **2. Supabase Sync Failure**
- **Current Issue**: Supabase sync not working, no visibility into sync status
- **User Problem**: Learning data not persisting, no way to troubleshoot
- **Solution**: Comprehensive sync monitoring, manual controls, offline queue management

### **3. Disabled Learning System**
- **Current Issue**: Learning view grayed out, no knowledge base building
- **User Problem**: No improvement in AI refinement quality over time
- **Solution**: Fully functional learning system with pattern tracking and effectiveness metrics

### **4. Unclear Dropzone Design**
- **Current Issue**: Cards don't communicate they accept file drops
- **User Problem**: Users don't discover file drop functionality
- **Solution**: Clear visual differentiation for dropzones with explicit file type support

### **5. Missing File Transcription**
- **Current Issue**: No way to transcribe audio/video files
- **User Problem**: Must use separate apps for file transcription
- **Solution**: Complete file transcription system with Apple Speech and cloud AI options
